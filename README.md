<h2>What is PCB ?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PCB stands for Printed Circuit Board. To make electronic circuits different type of things are used like Bread board, circuit board and the most advanced comes Printed circuit board. Using Bread boards or circuit boards , we cannot put huge circuits on a 10x10 sq.cm chip. This huge technology has been possible only by making larger and complicated circuits on a small chip.</p>

<h3>How to order at <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/">JLCPCB</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>First of all you need to design your PCB( you must know PCB designing in order to design a PCB ), which you need to get manufactured. Eagle, KiCAD and many more are the examples of softwares that can be used to design PCB.</li><li>Now save the PCB in the format of the gerber file in your local storage.</li><li>Then go to the <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/">JLCPCB </a>website.</li><li>Store your gerber file in a zip or rar ( zip and rar of size upto 10MB are acceptable ).</li><li>Upload the file.</li><li>Then you can see your PCB and customize it.</li><li>On <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/">JLCPCB </a>you can get your PCB manufactured at 2$ only ( 10 pieces ).</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is very easy to order on JLCPCB.com and you will get many customizable options rather than any other PCB manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Solder Mask Quality:</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The solder mask seems very thin in areas, and particularly around the backside copper of the heat sink portion. There were also some odd raised areas in the back side solder mask around the majority of the vias that at first I thought was because of the viaâ€™s annular ring, but after thinking about it for a moment, realized that those were vias straight into the ground plane, and that means there is no annular ring on that side.</p>

<h4><strong>Copper Layer Quality:</strong></h4>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The boards all tested correctly to 1oz copper thickness and the HASL surface finish was also good. </p>

<h2>SMT Assembly</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After you design and print your PCBs, the work is really not done right ðŸ˜‰!!! The next step is to arrange all the components on your PCB and make your circuit or module ready working with all the components. So, it is really important to get your SMD components to be placed on your PCB. But you have to be really skilled to perform this assembly of SMD components. But don't worry, JLCPCB.com covers you ðŸ˜Š</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://jlcpcb.com/">JLCPCB.com</a> provides you with the service of SMT assembly at very low cost with the best quality. They have a wide range of 40k+ SMD parts. If you are excited to know, you can reach out the JLCPCB SMD library <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jlcpcb.com/parts" target="_blank">https://jlcpcb.com/parts</a></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can reach out the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote?orderType=3&amp;stencilWidth=100&amp;stencilLength=100&amp;stencilCounts=5&amp;stencilLayer=2&amp;stencilPly=1.6&amp;steelmeshSellingPriceRecordNum=A8256537-5522-491C-965C-646F5842AEC9&amp;purchaseNumber=" target="_blank">JLCPCB SMT-Stencil</a> and can check out the cost of SMT assembly for your PCB board accordingly. You can provide with the BOM (Bill of Materials) with the JLCPCB to ensure all of your components in their library required for your PCB assembly. If by chance any of the components is missed because of inventory mismatch or some malfunction, JLCPCB will refund the cost according to their terms and conditions. If any of the component in the BOM does not match the component will not be placed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the designs and assembling are ensured to do with greater industrial standards. As JLCPCB receives thousands of orders, they ensure to produce their services with better and optimum quality. Although the price of SMT assembly at JLCPCB is comparatively low with better quality assurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a best option to manufacture your PCBs. I prefer this option with&nbsp;<em><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jlcpcb.com/" target="_blank">JLCPCB</a></strong></em>&nbsp;because professional PCBâ€™s are created at very low cost&nbsp;<strong>10 PCBâ€™s at 2 dollars, each pcb at 0.20 dollars â€¦<em>&nbsp;We could never manually do it for that price and even SMT assembly at this quality.</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allow to select the finish, the incredible black color, the quality of the PCBâ€™s and the impeccable serigraphy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Iâ€™m really happy with the service provided by <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/">JLCPCB</a>, in a very short time I made a prototype according to my own requirements and functionality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recommend this service as they mention on their page<a href="https://jlcpcb.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;jlcpcb.com</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Very good price.</li><li>100% guaranteed quality or rebirth.</li><li>Fast delivery time: 3 days by DHL.</li><li>Online purchase order.</li><li>Technical support, in case someone responds.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regarding the design, you can use any platform that allows you to generate the gerber file, maybe in the next tutorials you will do it from KiCAD, Eagle will use it some years ago but for now I will try to use Open source.</p>
